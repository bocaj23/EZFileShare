Required Updates or Fixes: 
-Client Cert Errors when running with keys not meant for localhost (create keys that Python TLS will accept)
-Fix the IP and Port Autoselection 
-Fix Reliabilty of file transfers (some files cut off too early)
-Set Time out for requests so users don't sit forever after sending a request if another user isn't available but is logged in
-Store friends list of each user on server so that it can be updated if they log in from a different computer
-Make sure that blank data.json and friends list files are generated on startup if no file exists in the directory
-Make friends list based on username so that multiple users can login from one application installation
-Add friends list update to periodic update so that friends will get removed from the recipients list even if they aren't online when the sender unfriends them
-Set up autogeneration for keys and certs on application startup (could use LetsEncrypt as a CA)
-Encrypt .json files so that users can't manually edit them
-Add Progress indicator for file transfers (Low Priority)
