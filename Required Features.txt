Required Updates or Fixes: 
-Client Cert Errors when running with keys not meant for localhost (create keys that Python TLS will accept)
-Fix the IP and Port Autoselection
-Fix User Server so connection error doesn't stop server from listening
-Modify Register User function to Avoid Sending IP (Grab from User Server Side via established connection)
-Avoid Sending Plaintext Password over TLS connection (Either encrypt with AES(or similar) or hash before sending)
-Rate Limit for Login Attempts, Friend Requests, RTS messages etc.
-Ability to cancel sent Friend or RTS requests
-Record to Log File, Import Log File
-Handle friend requests one by one on server side (check each friend request against recipient friend request list then remove one by one as requests are accepted or declined)
-Delete User Feature
-Fix Reliability of file transfers (some files cut off too early)
-Make sure that a blank data.json is generated on startup if no file exists in the directory (Pretty Sure this works correctly)
-Set up autogeneration for keys and certs on application startup (could use LetsEncrypt as a CA)
-Encrypt data.json file so that it can't be manually edited
-Add AES(or similar) encryption on top of TLS for all communications or transfers
-Add Progress indicator for file transfers (Low Priority)
